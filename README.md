Hey! I'm a little expert in computer science ðŸ˜Ž. I learned a lot of cool computer knowledge at Lingnan University. Like programming languages such as C, C++, and Java, I treat them as good friends and find it easy to write code with them.

Data structures and algorithms are no exception for me; I can come up with all sorts of clever ways to optimize them, feeling like playing a super thrilling intellectual gameðŸ§ .

In professional courses, I've learned a lot about operating systems, computer networks, and database principles. I know how operating systems manage computer resources, how network protocols allow information to flow through the network, and how databases obediently store data.
